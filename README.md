**Smart-Synergies Project**
This Django project scrapes data from LinkedIn profiles using Selenium. It provides a RESTful API endpoint to retrieve scraped data.

**Setup and Installation**
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:
**Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt**
Download the appropriate ChromeDriver executable from the ChromeDriver website and place it in the project directory.
Open the settings.py file and configure the chrome_driver_path variable to point to the location of the ChromeDriver executable.


**Usage**
Start the Django development server by running the following command in the project directory:
**Copy code
python manage.py runserver**
Access the API endpoint by sending a POST request to http://localhost:8000/api/url/. The request body should contain a JSON object with the url key and the LinkedIn profile URL as its value.
json
**Copy code
{
  "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/example-profile/"
}**
The API will return a JSON response containing the scraped data from the LinkedIn profile.


**Additional Notes**
The scraping process uses Selenium to automate interactions with the LinkedIn website. Make sure you have the appropriate version of ChromeDriver installed and configured.
The home view renders a simple HTML template (home.html). You can access it at the root URL (http://localhost:8000/) for testing purposes.
This project uses Django REST Framework for building the API endpoint and handling request/response serialization.
